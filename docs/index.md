# Project Idea

In light-polluted environments, stars are hard to see with the naked eye.
And also galaxy and planets need professional equipment to watch.
###What the universe looks like and what it's like to be surrounded by stars.###
This homework is made up of my yearning and imagination for the universeã€‚

# What you can find

- The planets revolves around you.
- Colorful nebula, and meteors.
- When a constellation turned in front of you, the stars will be line up.
- After download and install on your Android device, you can rotate to see what's around you.
